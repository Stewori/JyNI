/* List object interface */

/*
Another generally useful object type is an list of object pointers.
This is a mutable type: the list items can be changed, and items can be
added or removed.  Out-of-range indices or non-list objects are ignored.

*** WARNING *** PyList_SetItem does not increment the new item's reference
count, but does decrement the reference count of the item it replaces,
if not nil.  It does *decrement* the reference count if it is *not*
inserted in the list.  Similarly, PyList_GetItem does not increment the
returned item's reference count.
